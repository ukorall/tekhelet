name: hebrew-document-generator
description: Generate Hebrew documents (PDF, DOCX/Word, PPTX) with correct right-to-left layout, mixed Hebrew-and-English bidi handling, and Hebrew typography. Use whenever the output is a Hebrew or mixed Hebrew/English Word document, Hebrew PDF, or Hebrew PowerPoint ("Hebrew Word document", "מסמך Word בעברית", "create a .docx in Hebrew", "litstor hozeh"), or Israeli templates like Heshbonit Mas, Hozeh, or Protokol. ALSO use this for the symptom where a Hebrew document looks fine on screen or in Claude but comes out scrambled, reversed, or broken in Word, with English, numbers, or punctuation on the wrong side ("Hebrew text reversed in Word", "fix Hebrew formatting in Word"); the fix is regenerating the .docx with paragraph-level RTL/bidi, NOT a web/CSS RTL change. Prefer over the generic docx/pdf skills ONLY when the document is Hebrew or RTL; for English-only docs use the generic skill. Covers reportlab, WeasyPrint, python-docx, pptxgenjs. Do NOT use for OCR or reading existing documents (use hebrew-ocr-forms).

# Hebrew Document Generator

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose the Output Format

| Format | Library | Best For | RTL Support |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| PDF | reportlab | Invoices, tax docs, printable forms | Register Hebrew font, use `canvas.drawRightString()` |
| PDF | WeasyPrint | Styled documents from HTML/CSS | Native via `dir="rtl"` in HTML |
| DOCX | python-docx | Contracts, proposals, meeting minutes | Set paragraph `bidi`; split mixed runs, set `w:cs` font + `w:rtl` on Hebrew runs only |
| PPTX | pptxgenjs (Node) | Presentations, slide decks | RTL text boxes with `rtlMode: true` |

### Step 2: Install Dependencies and Hebrew Fonts

**Python PDF generation:**
```bash
pip install reportlab weasyprint
```

**Python DOCX generation:**
```bash
pip install python-docx python-bidi
```

**Node.js PPTX generation:**
```bash
npm install pptxgenjs
```

**Recommended Hebrew fonts (install on system):**

| Font | Style | Best For | Source |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Heebo | Sans-serif, modern | Web-style documents, invoices | Google Fonts |
| David | Classic serif | Legal contracts, formal letters | System (Windows/macOS) |
| Narkisim | Serif, elegant | Proposals, invitations | System (Windows) |
| Frank Ruehl | Traditional serif | Academic, literary | Google Fonts (Frank Ruhl Libre) |
| Rubik | Sans-serif, rounded | Presentations, marketing | Google Fonts |
| Assistant | Sans-serif, clean | Business correspondence | Google Fonts |

See `references/hebrew-fonts.md` for download links and installation instructions.

### Step 3: Generate Hebrew PDF with reportlab

See `scripts/generate_doc.py` for the full generation pipeline.

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import A4
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.pdfbase import pdfmetrics
from reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts import TTFont
from reportlab.lib.units import mm
from bidi import get_display  # python-bidi 0.6.x; see note below

# Register Hebrew font
pdfmetrics.registerFont(TTFont('Heebo', 'Heebo-Regular.ttf'))
pdfmetrics.registerFont(TTFont('Heebo-Bold', 'Heebo-Bold.ttf'))

def create_hebrew_pdf(filename, title, content_lines):
    c = canvas.Canvas(filename, pagesize=A4)
    width, height = A4

    # Title -- right-aligned for RTL
    c.setFont('Heebo-Bold', 18)
    hebrew_title = get_display(title)
    c.drawRightString(width - 20*mm, height - 30*mm, hebrew_title)

    # Body lines
    c.setFont('Heebo', 12)
    y = height - 50*mm
    for line in content_lines:
        display_line = get_display(line)
        c.drawRightString(width - 20*mm, y, display_line)
        y -= 7*mm

    c.save()
```

Key points for reportlab Hebrew:
- Always use `get_display()` from python-bidi to reorder characters
- Use `drawRightString()` for right-aligned RTL text
- Register TTF Hebrew fonts explicitly -- reportlab has no built-in Hebrew support
- Set line height to at least 1.5x font size for Hebrew readability
- **python-bidi import:** the canonical, recommended import is `from bidi import get_display` (top-level). The older `from bidi.algorithm import get_display` path still imports in current 0.6.x as a back-compat parallel module, but prefer the top-level one. python-bidi 0.6.x also dropped support for Python below 3.9.
- **Multi-line text:** `drawRightString()` draws a single line and does NOT wrap. For any body text longer than one line, use reportlab's `Paragraph` flowable (from `reportlab.platypus`) with a right-aligned, RTL `ParagraphStyle` instead. The bundled `scripts/generate_doc.py` uses per-line `drawRightString` for compact fixed-layout documents (invoices, receipts); it will clip long Hebrew strings. Reach for `Paragraph` / platypus flowables for contracts or any wrapping body copy.

### Mixed Hebrew / Latin / Digit Lines

The single most common RTL failure in generated documents is a line that mixes a Hebrew description with LTR numbers and a currency symbol, for example an invoice line item. `get_display()` handles the bidi reordering, but you must pass the *whole logical string* in one call so the algorithm sees the full context:

```python
from bidi import get_display

# Logical order: Hebrew description, then qty, unit price, currency
line = 'ייעוץ טכני (3 שעות) - 1,500.00 ש"ח'
c.setFont('Heebo', 11)
c.drawRightString(width - 20 * mm, y, get_display(line))
```

The digits, the comma, the period, and the parentheses all stay in their correct LTR positions because the bidi algorithm resolves them relative to the surrounding Hebrew. Do NOT split the line into pieces and reorder them yourself, and do NOT call `get_display()` on the Hebrew part only, both approaches break the number ordering.

### Step 4: Generate Hebrew PDF with WeasyPrint

```python
from weasyprint import HTML

html_content = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="he" dir="rtl">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<style>
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Heebo';
    src: url('Heebo-Regular.ttf');
  }
  body {
    font-family: 'Heebo', sans-serif;
    direction: rtl;
    font-size: 12pt;
    line-height: 1.7;
  }
  h1 { font-size: 18pt; text-align: start; }
  table {
    width: 100%;
    border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  th, td {
    border: 1px solid #333;
    padding: 6px 10px;
    text-align: start;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>חשבונית מס</h1>
  <!-- Document content here -->
</body>
</html>
"""

HTML(string=html_content).write_pdf('invoice.pdf')
```

WeasyPrint advantages for Hebrew:
- Full CSS support including logical properties
- Native RTL via HTML `dir` attribute
- Tables render correctly in RTL
- Supports `@font-face` for custom Hebrew fonts

### Step 5: Generate Hebrew DOCX with python-docx

DOCX is where mixed Hebrew/English breaks most often, and Microsoft Word's bidi engine is stricter than the Unicode standard. LibreOffice, macOS Preview/Quick Look, and most viewers render forgiving output that HIDES Word-only bugs, so always verify in Word itself, not a substitute renderer. Four rules, each learned against real Word:

1. Every Hebrew paragraph carries `<w:bidi/>` (RTL base direction); a pure-English line (a lab value, a drug name, an English-only row) gets LTR base + left alignment instead. The helper picks this per paragraph from whether the line contains any Hebrew, so English-only rows do not hang off the right margin in an otherwise Hebrew document.
2. **Do NOT put `<w:rtl/>` on the runs of a MIXED Hebrew+English paragraph.** This is the single biggest Word trap. Word honors `<w:rtl/>` strictly: any Latin or number that lands in (or beside) an rtl-flagged run gets force-reversed, so `7/2023` prints as `2023/7`, an embedded `KI-67` code flips, and the parentheses around a mixed group like `(גסטרית, KI-67)` mis-pair. In a mixed paragraph the paragraph's own `<w:bidi/>` already orders the line correctly, leave every run unflagged.
3. **Flag `<w:rtl/>` ONLY on Hebrew runs of a paragraph that has no Latin letters** (a pure-Hebrew label or heading, digits allowed). There the flag is what anchors a trailing colon (`מחלות רקע:`) to the left end. A leading section-number marker (`2.`, `10.`) is additionally merged into the Hebrew run (`_merge_list_marker`) so its period does not flip to `.2`; a date like `13/01/2026` is left as its own LTR run so Word does not reverse it. The split stays by script so each run still gets the right complex-script font.
4. Every run sets the complex-script font (`w:cs`) and size (`w:szCs`). Hebrew is a "complex script" in Word's model, so `w:ascii`/`w:sz` alone never govern the Hebrew glyphs. Omitting `w:cs`/`w:szCs` is the most common cause of "the font/size I set did nothing and the Hebrew looks broken". Bold and italic are the same: `w:b`/`w:i` only affect Latin, you also need `w:bCs`/`w:iCs`. **Never insert Unicode directional isolates (U+2066-2069) or marks to force order, Word renders them as visible `.notdef` boxes in the David font even though other viewers hide them.**

**Do NOT call `get_display()` on DOCX text.** Unlike reportlab (which draws pre-positioned glyphs and therefore needs python-bidi to reorder them), Word applies the bidi algorithm itself. Pre-shaping a string with `get_display()` and then handing it to python-docx double-applies the algorithm and scrambles the result. `get_display()` belongs to the PDF path only.

This helper covers body paragraphs. **Headers/footers and numbered/bulleted lists** are separate document stories the helper does not reach: apply the same `<w:bidi/>` + per-script-run logic to each of their paragraphs, and add `<w:bidi/>` to the section `sectPr` for full RTL page flow. **Tables need one extra step beyond per-cell text direction**, covered next.

### Hebrew Tables in DOCX (the "table comes out reversed" fix)

The single most-reported Hebrew DOCX table bug is **the whole table coming out mirror-reversed**: the first logical column (e.g. `תיאור`) lands on the LEFT instead of the right, so the table reads backwards. This is NOT a per-cell text-direction problem, it is a **column-order** problem, and it has a separate cause and fix.

python-docx creates a table with NO `<w:bidiVisual/>` on its `<w:tblPr>`. In an RTL Hebrew document Word still lays the columns out left-to-right, so column 0 sits on the left. Fixing the text inside each cell does nothing about this, the columns are still in LTR visual order. There are therefore **two independent fixes, and a Hebrew table needs BOTH**:

1. **Column order, set once per table:** `table.table_direction = WD_TABLE_DIRECTION.RTL`. This emits `<w:bidiVisual/>` on `<w:tblPr>`, which mirrors the visual column order so the first logical column renders on the right. This is the actual fix for "the table is reversed". Also set `table.alignment = WD_TABLE_ALIGNMENT.RIGHT` so the table block hugs the right margin instead of floating left.
2. **Text inside each cell:** every cell holds its own paragraph (a separate story `add_rtl_paragraph` does not reach), so give each cell paragraph `<w:bidi/>` (RTL base) and run its text through the same per-script-run logic from Step 5.

**Cell alignment, the one trap to get right:** do NOT set a physical "right" alignment on the cell paragraphs. In OOXML `w:jc` is **logical, not physical**: `right` means "the END of the line". In a Hebrew (`<w:bidi/>`) paragraph the line ends on the LEFT, so a `RIGHT` alignment actually pushes Hebrew text to the visual **left** (numbers, being LTR runs, would still go right, so you get the headers on the left and the numbers on the right, a mismatched mess, this was the v1.7.0 bug). The fix is to set NO explicit alignment: a cell paragraph carrying `<w:bidi/>` defaults to its START edge, which is the visual RIGHT. Give every cell `<w:bidi/>` and leave alignment unset, and headers, Hebrew text, and numbers all line up flush right. Verified in Microsoft Word.

```python
from docx.enum.table import WD_TABLE_DIRECTION, WD_TABLE_ALIGNMENT

def set_cell_rtl_text(cell, text, font='David', size=11, bold=False):
    """Fill an RTL table cell. Reuses _split_by_script / _merge_list_marker /
    _shift_boundary_spaces from Step 5. Gives the cell paragraph <w:bidi/> (RTL base)
    and sets NO explicit alignment: an RTL paragraph defaults to its START edge =
    visual RIGHT, so headers, Hebrew, and numbers all align flush right. Do NOT add a
    physical RIGHT alignment here, w:jc is logical (right = line END = visual LEFT in
    RTL), which is exactly what left-aligns Hebrew cells against right-aligned numbers."""
    p = cell.paragraphs[0]
    p.text = ''  # clear the empty default run
    pPr = p._p.get_or_add_pPr()
    pPr.append(pPr.makeelement(qn('w:bidi'), {}))  # RTL base -> start edge = visual right; no w:jc

            qn('w:ascii'): font, qn('w:hAnsi'): font, qn('w:cs'): font}))

        if is_rtl and not para_has_latin:
            rPr.append(rPr.makeelement(qn('w:rtl'), {}))

def add_rtl_table(doc, headers, rows, font='David', size=11):
    """Add a Hebrew table whose COLUMNS read right-to-left (first column on the right)
    and whose cells (headers, Hebrew, numbers) all align flush right."""
    table = doc.add_table(rows=1 + len(rows), cols=len(headers))
    table.style = 'Table Grid'
    table.table_direction = WD_TABLE_DIRECTION.RTL   # <-- emits <w:bidiVisual/>, the column-order fix
    table.alignment = WD_TABLE_ALIGNMENT.RIGHT       # table block hugs the right margin
    for j, h in enumerate(headers):
        set_cell_rtl_text(table.rows[0].cells[j], h, font=font, size=size, bold=True)
    for i, row in enumerate(rows, start=1):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            set_cell_rtl_text(table.rows[i].cells[j], str(val), font=font, size=size)
    return table

# Logical column order is left-to-right in your data; bidiVisual flips the VISUAL order to RTL.
add_rtl_table(doc,
    ['תיאור', 'כמות', 'מחיר', 'סה"כ'],
    [['ייעוץ טכני (3 שעות)', 1, '1,500.00', '1,500.00'],
     ['פיתוח Acme', 2, '600.00', '1,200.00']])
```

You still write headers/rows in natural left-to-right logical order in your Python list; `bidiVisual` only changes how Word *displays* them. **Do NOT try to "fix" a reversed table by reversing your column list in Python**, that double-reverses once `bidiVisual` is set and scrambles mixed LTR cells. Set `table_direction = RTL` and keep your data in logical order. For an **invoice totals block** (סכום ביניים / מע"מ / סה"כ לתשלום) the label cell usually spans the description columns via a horizontal merge (`row.cells[a].merge(row.cells[b])`); a merged span can mirror to the wrong side under `bidiVisual`, so verify the merged totals row in Word specifically. As with all DOCX work, verify in Word itself, not LibreOffice or Preview, which mirror tables more forgivingly and hide the bug.

### Step 6: Generate Hebrew PPTX with pptxgenjs

```javascript
const pptxgen = require('pptxgenjs');
const pptx = new pptxgen();

pptx.layout = 'LAYOUT_16x9';
pptx.rtlMode = true;

const slide = pptx.addSlide();

// Hebrew title
slide.addText('סקירה רבעונית', {
  x: 0.5, y: 0.5, w: '90%', h: 1.0,
  fontSize: 28,
  fontFace: 'Heebo',
  color: '1a1a2e',
  align: 'right',
  rtlMode: true,
  bold: true,
});

// Hebrew bullet points
slide.addText([
  { text: 'תוצאות כספיות', options: { bullet: true, rtlMode: true } },
  { text: 'יעדים לרבעון הבא', options: { bullet: true, rtlMode: true } },
  { text: 'סיכום פעילות', options: { bullet: true, rtlMode: true } },
], {
  x: 0.5, y: 2.0, w: '90%', h: 3.0,
  fontSize: 18,
  fontFace: 'Heebo',
  align: 'right',
  rtlMode: true,
});

pptx.writeFile({ fileName: 'quarterly-review.pptx' });

**PPTX tables** have the same RTL column-order concern as DOCX. pptxgenjs renders table columns in the order of your `rows` array, it does not auto-mirror for RTL. So that the first logical column reads on the right, reverse the cell order per row in your data, and set `rtlMode: true` (plus `align: 'right'`) on every cell's `options` so the text inside each cell is right-aligned and bidi-handled:

```javascript
// Logical columns: תיאור | כמות | מחיר. Reverse per row so col 1 displays on the right
const headers = ['תיאור', 'כמות', 'מחיר'];
const dataRows = [['ייעוץ', '1', '1,500.00']];
const opt = { rtlMode: true, align: 'right', fontFace: 'Heebo' };
const tableRows = [headers, ...dataRows].map(
  row => [...row].reverse().map(text => ({ text, options: opt }))
);
slide.addTable(tableRows, { x: 0.5, y: 1.5, w: 9, rtlMode: true });
```

Note the opposite convention from DOCX: python-docx exposes a real `bidiVisual` column-flip (`table_direction = RTL`) so you keep data in logical order, whereas pptxgenjs has no such flag, so you reverse the columns in the data yourself. Verify the rendered slide.

### Step 7: Israeli Business Document Templates

See `references/templates.md` for complete field specifications per document type.

| Template | Hebrew Name | Required Fields |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Tax Invoice | חשבונית מס | Business name, Osek Murshe number, date, line items, VAT (18%), total |
| Contract | חוזה | Parties, TZ/company numbers, terms, signatures, date |
| Price Proposal | הצעת מחיר | Business details, itemized pricing, validity period, terms |
| Meeting Minutes | פרוטוקול | Date, attendees, agenda, decisions, action items |
| Receipt | קבלה | Business name, receipt number, amount, payment method, date |

**Tax Invoice (Heshbonit Mas) required fields by Israeli law:**
- Business name and address
- Osek Murshe (authorized dealer) number
- Sequential invoice number
- Date of issue
- Customer name and TZ/company number
- Line items with description, quantity, unit price
- Subtotal, VAT at 18%, and total in NIS
- **Allocation number (Mispar Haktzaa / מספר הקצאה) under the Israel Invoices model** for a tax invoice at or above the current threshold. The threshold is being phased down (20,000 NIS in 2025, 10,000 NIS from Jan 2026, **5,000 NIS from 1 June 2026**, pre-VAT). At/above the threshold the BUYER cannot deduct the input VAT unless the seller obtained a Tax Authority allocation number and printed it on the invoice. Add an allocation-number field to any invoice template and treat the threshold as time-sensitive (verify the current figure against Rashut HaMisim).

## Examples

### Example 1: Generate Tax Invoice PDF
User says: "Create a Hebrew tax invoice PDF for my business"
Result: Use reportlab or WeasyPrint to generate A4 PDF with RTL layout, business header, sequential invoice number, itemized table, VAT calculation at 18%, totals in NIS with shekel symbol, and Hebrew font throughout.

### Example 2: Create Hebrew Contract DOCX
User says: "Draft a Hebrew service contract as a Word document"
Result: Use python-docx with the `add_rtl_paragraph` helper (Step 5): `<w:bidi/>` paragraphs, per-script run splitting so embedded English/numbers stay in place, `w:cs` font + `w:szCs` size, David font, RTL alignment, structured sections (parties, scope, payment terms, termination, signatures), proper Hebrew legal phrasing.

### Example 3: Build Hebrew Presentation
User says: "Make a Hebrew PowerPoint for our quarterly review"
Result: Use pptxgenjs with rtlMode enabled, Heebo font, right-aligned text boxes, RTL bullet points, Hebrew slide titles, and professional layout.

### Example 4: Batch Document Generation
User says: "Generate 50 Hebrew invoices from a CSV file"
Result: Read CSV data, iterate rows, use `scripts/generate_doc.py` to produce individual PDFs with unique invoice numbers, customer details, and line items per row.

## Bundled Resources

### Scripts
- `scripts/generate_doc.py` - Generate Hebrew PDF documents with reportlab: register Hebrew fonts, apply RTL text reordering with python-bidi, produce Israeli business documents (invoices, receipts) with proper VAT calculations and NIS formatting. Run: `python scripts/generate_doc.py --help`

### References
- `references/hebrew-fonts.md` - Hebrew font catalog with recommended fonts for different document types (sans-serif, serif, monospace), Google Fonts download links, system font availability matrix, font pairing suggestions, and installation instructions for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- `references/templates.md` - Israeli business document templates with required fields per document type (tax invoice, contract, proposal, receipt, meeting minutes), Israeli legal requirements for invoices, VAT rules, and standard Hebrew business phrasing.

For binding legal requirements always confirm against the current Israel Tax Authority (Rashut HaMisim) guidance, the Wikipedia entry is a starting orientation, not the authority.

## Recommended MCP Servers

No MCP server applies to this skill. Hebrew document generation runs entirely through local Python and Node libraries (reportlab, WeasyPrint, python-docx, pptxgenjs); there is no external service to wrap as an MCP server. Use the bundled scripts and the code in the Instructions section directly.

## Gotchas
- `get_display()` must be applied per line at draw time, immediately before `drawRightString()`, NOT once on a whole multi-line document or block. The bidi algorithm is not idempotent: running it on text that was already reordered double-reverses the characters and produces scrambled output. A common agent mistake is to "pre-process" a whole list of lines through `get_display()` and then call it again inside the draw loop.
- PDF generators often default to left-to-right text flow. Hebrew documents MUST use RTL paragraph direction, and mixed Hebrew-English text requires proper BiDi (bidirectional) algorithm support.
- DOCX (python-docx) has the opposite trap from PDF: do NOT run `get_display()` on the text, Word applies the bidi algorithm itself and pre-shaping double-reverses it. The two failure modes that produce "broken" Hebrew Word files are (a) putting a whole mixed Hebrew/English line in ONE run flagged `<w:rtl/>` (the English jumps sides and punctuation reflows) and (b) setting only `w:ascii`/`w:sz` and never the complex-script `w:cs` font / `w:szCs` size (your font and size silently never apply to the Hebrew). Split mixed lines per script, flag only Hebrew runs rtl, and set `w:cs` + `w:szCs` on every run.
- A run with no explicit direction inherits the paragraph base direction. After `add_rtl_paragraph` adds a Hebrew paragraph, appending another run later (e.g. a signature line) without re-running the per-script split can leave that run unmarked, set its direction explicitly rather than assuming it inherits correctly.
- A reversed Hebrew DOCX *table* (first column on the left) is a COLUMN-ORDER bug, not a text-direction one. `add_rtl_paragraph` and per-cell bidi do nothing about it: python-docx tables have no `<w:bidiVisual/>`, so Word lays columns out LTR. Set `table.table_direction = WD_TABLE_DIRECTION.RTL` on the table AND run each cell through the per-cell bidi helper, you need both (see "Hebrew Tables in DOCX"). Keep your column data in logical order, reversing it yourself double-reverses once `bidiVisual` is set.
- Agents may pick fonts that lack Hebrew character support (e.g., Arial works, but many decorative Latin fonts do not). Always verify the font includes the Hebrew Unicode range (U+0590-U+05FF).
- Hebrew date formatting uses DD/MM/YYYY in secular context and Hebrew calendar dates (e.g., 15 Adar 5786) for religious/traditional documents. Agents may default to MM/DD/YYYY.
- Legal documents in Israel require specific formatting: nikud (vowel marks) is NOT used in standard business/legal Hebrew. Agents may add nikud thinking it improves clarity, but it actually looks unprofessional in formal documents.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Hebrew characters display as boxes or question marks"
Cause: Hebrew font not registered or not found on system
Solution: Download a Hebrew TTF font (e.g., Heebo from Google Fonts), register it with `pdfmetrics.registerFont()` for reportlab, or install it as a system font for WeasyPrint.

### Error: "Text appears left-to-right instead of right-to-left"
Cause: Missing bidi reordering or RTL direction setting
Solution: For reportlab, apply `get_display()` from python-bidi. For python-docx, build paragraphs with the `add_rtl_paragraph` helper in Step 5 (sets `<w:bidi/>` on the paragraph and `<w:rtl/>` on the Hebrew runs). For WeasyPrint, ensure `dir="rtl"` on the HTML element.

### Error: "Numbers and punctuation in wrong position"
Cause: Bidirectional text algorithm not handling mixed Hebrew/number content
Solution: For reportlab, pass the whole logical string through `get_display()` in one call (see "Mixed Hebrew / Latin / Digit Lines"). In HTML-based tools (WeasyPrint), ensure proper `unicode-bidi: isolate` on embedded LTR spans. For DOCX/python-docx, do the OPPOSITE of the PDF fix: never call `get_display()` (Word reorders itself). Set `<w:bidi/>` on the paragraph, split the line into per-script runs, flag only the Hebrew runs `<w:rtl/>`, and set the `w:cs` font + `w:szCs` size on every run (see Step 5's `add_rtl_paragraph`).

### Error: "Hebrew Word (.docx) renders with English on the wrong side, or my font/size is ignored"
Cause: The whole mixed line is in one run marked `<w:rtl/>` (English jumps), or the runs set only `w:ascii`/`w:sz` and never the complex-script `w:cs`/`w:szCs` (Hebrew ignores the font/size). A bare presence check for `<w:rtl/>` passes on a file that still renders broken, so verify the run structure, not just the flag.
Solution: Use the `add_rtl_paragraph` helper in Step 5: per-script run splitting, rtl on Hebrew runs only, `w:cs` + `w:szCs` on every run.

### Error: "Hebrew table (.docx) comes out reversed, the first column is on the left"
Cause: This is a COLUMN-ORDER bug, not a text-direction one. python-docx tables ship with no `<w:bidiVisual/>` on `<w:tblPr>`, so Word lays the columns out left-to-right and the first logical column lands on the left, making the whole table read backwards. Fixing the text inside each cell does not move the columns.
Solution: Set `table.table_direction = WD_TABLE_DIRECTION.RTL` once per table (emits `<w:bidiVisual/>`, which mirrors the visual column order to RTL), AND run each cell's text through the per-cell bidi helper. Both are needed, see "Hebrew Tables in DOCX". Keep your header/row data in natural logical order, do NOT reverse the column list yourself, that double-reverses once `bidiVisual` is set. Verify in Word, not LibreOffice/Preview (they mirror tables more forgivingly and hide this).

### Error: "Hebrew table cells are aligned to the left (headers/text on the left, numbers on the right)"
Cause: A physical `RIGHT` alignment was set on the cell paragraphs. `w:jc` in OOXML is LOGICAL, not physical: `right` means "line END", and in a Hebrew `<w:bidi/>` paragraph the line ends on the LEFT, so a RIGHT alignment pushes Hebrew to the visual left while LTR number cells still go right, leaving the table ragged and mismatched.
Solution: Do NOT set any explicit alignment on RTL table cells. Give each cell paragraph `<w:bidi/>` and leave alignment unset, an RTL paragraph defaults to its START edge (the visual right), so headers, Hebrew text, and numbers all line up flush right. See `set_cell_rtl_text` in "Hebrew Tables in DOCX".
